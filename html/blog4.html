                <h1>My new Journal as a bootcamp student.</h1>
                <p class="text">
                    After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                    I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews 
                    of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                <h2 class="journal-title">How I stay commited to learning</h2>
                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
                    I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try 
                    to create simple projects using what I learned or 
                    work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful 
                    to share what I was learning and most things about 
                    my journey with the world.
                </p>
    
                <h2>How I got started</h2>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
                    I would take notes about what I was learning. After each 
                    learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on 
                    what I learned but also write short summaries of what I 
                    learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that 
                    posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn 
                    and stay motivated.
                </p>
